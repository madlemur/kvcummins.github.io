After seeing posts by several people in my Google+ circles, I finally decided to dip my toes into the potentially devastating hobby subculture of Gunpla. Based on helpful posts and some personal research (and an eye on my wallet), I decided to start with the 1/144 scale HGUC (High Grade Universal Century) models. It seems to bring together many of the recent innovations in design and production, but in a manageable size (and cost).

I'd love to be able to afford the Master Grade or Perfect Grade models, but they are much too large and too expensive for my budget and skill level. Maybe I'll treat myself someday.

Anyway, I decided to get *two* models. After watching a few of the original series, I decided to go with Amuro's RX-78-2 Gundam Mobile Suit and Char's MS-06S Zaku II Suit.
