Recently, [Paratope](https://www.paratope.co) has released some new screenshots from their "sky engine" (thoroughly customized [Unity](https://www.unity.com) engine), and it's looking quite good. Aside from the lighting and coloring being really good, it appears that the procedural terrain generation is really spot on, at least for the biomes we've seen so far.

The images below are downsampled. If you are interested in seeing the full-resolution images, go to the [Skyclimbers Discord](https://discord.gg/3JSVatNVFV) server, or follow the [Skyclimbers Twitter](https://twitter.com/playskyclimbers) account.
