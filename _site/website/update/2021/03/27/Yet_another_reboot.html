		<h1>Yet another reboot...</h1>
        <p>Hello again. It’s been several years since I last posted <em>anything</em> (and who knows, it may be years until I post again).</p>

<p>Rebooting into a new format, as the system I was using had become outdated, and was non-standard. So I’ve switched back to a more standard system that I can keep up to date with more ease.</p>

<p>I’ll try to bring some of my Gunpla content back up to date (and maybe add some more), I’m looking to add some CNC content (much love to <a href="https://www.v1engineering.com">V1 Engineering</a>), and I’m also going to work on putting up some <a href="https://www.skyclimbers.net/">Sky Climbers</a> content as my involvement in the Alpha phase(s) begin to ramp up (and as any NDAs/releases allow).</p>
