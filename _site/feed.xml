It’s been several years since I last posted &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; (and who knows, it may be years until I post again).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebooting into a new format, as the system I was using had become outdated, and was non-standard. So I’ve switched back to a more standard system that I can keep up to date with more ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll try to bring some of my Gunpla content back up to date (and maybe add some more), I’m looking to add some CNC content (much love to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.v1engineering.com&quot;&gt;V1 Engineering&lt;/a&gt;), and I’m also going to work on putting up some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skyclimbers.net/&quot;&gt;Sky Climbers&lt;/a&gt; content as my involvement in the Alpha phase(s) begin to ramp up (and as any NDAs/releases allow).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="website" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html">Hello again.

I’ve gotten some LEDs, an LCD panel, and a number of switches and buttons. So far, I have KSPSerialIO talking to my Arduino, and lighting up the basic indicators (main alarm, SAS, RCS, brakes, gear, lights, abort, and connection), and I’m trying to get my LCD screen to display the apoapsis and periapsis, but something is amiss in how I’m converting the float all the way to a string.&lt;/p&gt;

Based on helpful posts and some personal research (and an eye on my wallet), I decided to start with the 1/144 scale HGUC (High Grade Universal Century) models. It seems to bring together many of the recent innovations in design and production, but in a manageable size (and cost).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to be able to afford the Master Grade or Perfect Grade models, but they are much too large and too expensive for my budget and skill level. Maybe I’ll treat myself someday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I decided to get &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; models. After watching a few of the original series, I decided to go with Amuro’s RX-78-2 Gundam Mobile Suit and Char’s MS-06S Zaku II Suit.&lt;/p&gt;
